# SQL Course Notes

This project is a personal workspace for learning SQL database commands. It contains practice scripts and notes while I study core SQL topics.

## What is inside
- `sqlintro.sql` ? starter script with basic SQL practice.

## Topics I plan to cover
- `CREATE DATABASE`, `CREATE TABLE`, and data types
- `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- `SELECT`, filtering, sorting, and limiting
- Joins: `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL`
- Aggregations: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`
- `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
- Constraints: `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `NOT NULL`
- Indexes and basic performance ideas

## How I use this repo
- Add new `.sql` files per topic or lesson.
- Run scripts in my SQL environment of choice (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).

## Next steps
- Add sample datasets.
- Add more practice queries.
- Add notes on common errors and fixes.
