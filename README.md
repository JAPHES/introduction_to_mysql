# SQL Learning Project

This repository is my practice space for learning SQL database commands.

## Project Files
- `sqlintro.sql`: practice queries for table creation, schema changes, inserts, filtering, and updates.

## What I Practice Here
- Creating tables (`CREATE TABLE`)
- Updating table structure (`ALTER TABLE`)
- Inserting records (`INSERT INTO`)
- Querying data (`SELECT`, `WHERE`)
- Modifying existing records (`UPDATE`)
- Removing columns (`ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN`)

## How to Use
1. Open `sqlintro.sql` in your SQL editor or database client.
2. Uncomment one block at a time.
3. Run each block and verify results with `SELECT *` queries.
4. Keep notes on errors and fixes as you learn.

## Suggested Learning Roadmap
1. DDL basics: `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`
2. DML basics: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
3. Querying: `SELECT`, filtering, ordering, limits
4. Joins and aggregations: `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
5. Constraints and indexing basics

## Next Improvements
- Add separate `.sql` files by topic (for example: `01_ddl.sql`, `02_dml.sql`)
- Add sample datasets for repeatable practice
- Add advanced query practice (joins, subqueries, aggregates)
